## Hotbars+
Hotbars+ (also known as "MultiHotbar" in earlier versions) is a mod for Minecraft that dramatically increases how many hotbars can be saved by paginating the vanilla hotbar storage system.

### How does it work?
The mod works by hijacking the saved hotbar system Minecraft uses to use a different file to load and save from in place of the traditional `hotbar.nbt`, hot-swapping files for each page.

### What is required to use the mod?
The requirements depend on the version of Minecraft you're using. To help guide you, here's a table:

| Version         | Fabric Loader | Fabric API | Cotton Client Commands |
|-----------------| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 1.20.3 - 1.20.4 | Yes           | Yes        | No                     |

\* = The mod will still launch without it, but you won't be able to run client-side commands like /hotbars+.
