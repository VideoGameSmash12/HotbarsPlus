## Hotbars+
Hotbars+ (also known as "MultiHotbar" in earlier versions) is a mod for Minecraft that dramatically increases how many hotbars can be saved by paginating the vanilla hotbar storage system.

### How does it work?
The mod works by hijacking the saved hotbar system Minecraft uses to use a different file to load and save from in place of the traditional `hotbar.nbt`, hot-swapping files for each page. A simple concept, yes, but it works beautifully.
